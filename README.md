# Cidon's DFS Implementaion

This program implements a optimized Dept-First-Search alogirhm in C#. The net program is a network simulator to simulate the delay on the 
network, thus simulating the asynchronous network.

Use the batch file to pass the neighbour nodes number as arguments.
The config file specifies the port that the nodes are using and the delay between each arch. Those are not specified would be given a default
delay, which is 10 logical time.
